A Java wrapper for Sky Unlimited Inc.'s Proofing and Output scripts.

What is this?
-------------

This is a Java wrapper that initiates a call to the Adobe ExtendScript Proofing and Output scripts that are used internally for Sky Unlimited, Inc.'s art department.

Can I download and use this?
----------------------------

Clearly, this can be downloaded by anyone, but chances are that it simply will not work for you. It is built specifically for Sky's file structure, so if you try to run the code as-is, you will likely get errors. And that's not even mentioning the many headaches you'll get just from trying to understand my spaghetti code from writing this as a Java beginner.

Why is it here?
---------------

Versioning. I wanted a way to keep track of what I changed in each version of the wrapper, and I didn't want to use a plain Word document or Excel spreadsheet. I looked for a more 'proper' way of keeping track of versions and git + GitHub seemed to win.

Can I contribute?
-----------------

If you really feel altruistic enough, then I am more than willing to accept any and all critique, provided it is constructive. i.e., just telling me that my code is crap isn't helpful. Please offer suggestions for optimizing the code, making the error handling better, and ideas for de-spaghettifying it. I promise to take them all to heart and (when I have time) put them to good use.
